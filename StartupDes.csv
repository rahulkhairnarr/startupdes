However, the real value of Medium isn’t our tools. It’s all about the network, the connections with other people, and the stories you create. Well-designed networks reduce friction and help good stuff be found. Connections allow the whole to become greater than the sum of the parts and allow new paths to discover and build meaning. After all, isn’t that what every writer wants?



Read actively 



The world has reached a saturation point of shallow, thoughtless content, and half-skimming through these pages of filler is increasingly unfulfilling. Every day, your Medium homepage is full of stories with depth and meaning — Stories that make you laugh, cry, and actually feel things.



Reading these stories is not a passive activity. At Medium, we are building a better way to read. Every highlight you leave changes the way others interpret the story — and maybe even the way author thinks about what they wrote.



Influence the discussion Discourse is necessary. Ideas grow by bumping into other brains and breathing in fresh air. That’s why we created Medium Responses. Beyond a simple comment, Responses are your opportunity to influence the discussion. And since Responses are their own posts, they build on each other and evolve the original idea in new and unexpected directions.



When you sign up for Medium, you are joining a community of millions of thinkers and doers offering their best ideas and moving conversation forward on the biggest issues and interests of the day. Because great writing deserves a great audience."

It looks at automating and bringing in efficiencies for the clinic in managing patient contacts and scheduling appointments.

                         courage with him. The pursuance of serving the society always lured him to impart education and knowledge to the youth of the country. With this objective in mind, he entered into the world of online education with a not so ordinary project. Mr. Godara noticed and grabbed the opportunity to build a website that can fulfil the needs of every student and satisfy his motto. The eminent idea of serving the youth of the country was soon going to become a stark reality. The date was 14th November 2013 when the impeccable idea of Wifistudy.com was introduced to the nation. The ingenious website became an instant hit within a few months amongst the students. The appreciation it received from the users was commendable and laudable. The admiration from the people inspired the company to serve them beyond their expectations. The website was at full roar but still, the company had a lot to explore with this unique project because it was just a starting and the victory was approaching us.



Splendid Journey of Wifistudy.com

From a small website to one of the biggest education portal in India, the company has witnessed all the accomplishments of Wifistudy.com. The website, with no external fundraising, climbed the stairs of success in no time and became one of the nation’s most popular, widespread, and influential education websites. Wifistudy.com was launched for the people on 14th November 2013 and it was an instant success for the company. Initially, it contributed to all the latest news and information about various exams and conducted online test series for the students. Since then, a lot of things have been changed, the website too. Wifistudy.com has been completely revamped from its design language to the services it offers. The website now has an attractive and pleasant UI and a lot of advanced facilities up it sleeves. The main services offered by Wifistudy.com to its users are as follows:

All the helpful information about the exams can be instantly available on the mobile phones and laptops.

The website offers various online test series and mock test series to the students for recruitment exams of state and national level.

Not only this, latest education videos and tutorials are updated daily on the YouTube channel of WiFiStudy. 



The Man behind Wifistudy.com

Launching a startup without any external support is not simple. Constant efforts and hard work are required to cope with the competition and rise above them. Mr. Dinesh Godara, the man behind Wifistudy.com, is the Co-founder of DLB Group of Companies and Managing Director (MD) at DLB Infotech Pvt Ltd. His passion towards serving the society and his result oriented approach helps him to achieve what all he wants. He has all the excellence and dedication to perceive his dreams. Apart from work, cricket and tech gadgets attract him the most. He usually spends his personal time with his laptop and headphones on.   



Future Prospects of Wifistudy.com

When Wifistudy.com was started, it was clear that the company will reach greater heights in the near future. As believed, in a matter of 4 years, Wifistudy.com is now one of the greatest and most prominent education portal in India. It is one of the most trusted online brands in the country. 



As other startups, the vision for the future of Wifistudy.com is crystal clear. The company is targeting the worldwide reach. The main objective of the company is to become a global leader and surpass the competition. The hardworking team of Wifistudy.com is making constant efforts to earn the appreciation from the students across the world and invent newer ways to impart education to its users efficiently. The company also aims to increase the usefulness of the portal amongst the people by covering the uncultivated land. Suppose what if a person grabs the phone to check Wifistudy.com website instead of the newspaper in the morning. It would be the most delightful sight for us. Be assured, the website will be at greater heights but still, the company will have a lot to explore because it would be just a beginning, the future will be knocking the doors and the success will be tasted."

To be creative simply means to create. And that’s something we do all the time. 



We tell stories even if we’re not writers. We think new thoughts even if we’re not thinkers. We experiment with recipes even if we’re not chefs. And we create spaces even if we’re not designers.

The ENEM (Brazil's #1 university entrance exam that Descomplica is focused on) is taken by 9M Brazilian students/yr, and offers an excellent opportunity to capture Brazilian students early."

You can register a new domain name directly with Rebrandly, choosing among more than 500 extensions- from .link to .pizza, and everything in between. We take care of all the setup for you, allowing you to start sharing branded links in just a few minutes. 



A branded link is memorable, pronounceable and completely customizable. With a branded link, companies and individuals increase their brand’s visibility because the brand name is embedded in the link- even when it’s being shared by others. They improve link trust, and in fact branded links can help to increase the click through rate by up to 39% when compared to generic short links. Important brands and influencers are adopting branded links as the best alternative to generic short URLs. 



By utilizing branded links, brands are more effectively representing the content they share because they are associating themselves with it from the start. This builds trust on behalf of the audience because it makes it clear that what’s being shared is really endorsed by the brand itself. 



Although there are a variety of URL shortening services on the market, Rebrandly is unique in providing a completely customizable link branding service. We believe the days of the generic short link are numbered, and that branded links are the way of the future. No other company has the breadth of features wrapped up into a single tool like the one offered by us."

It comes with a number of resolution, format and compression options. Users' video files get processed on the client before they get uploaded. 



As a result, the site owner gets smaller files - which upload faster - in 1 standard format of their choice (MP4, WebM, FLV,...). This reduces or even eliminates costs involved in server-side video transcoding. 



The API is built using HTML5 - no Flash or other outdated plugins involved. It works in desktop and mobile browsers.



All user-generated videos get processed on the client device inside the browser and uploaded from there to the site owner's cloud storage, they don't get routed through or processed on Clipchamp servers. 



Client-side processing reduces server-side transcoding costs and infrastructure complexity. In addition, the Clipchamp API works on desktop and mobile and is cross-browser compatible."

These work on all devices — desktops, tablets and even mobile phones — so you don’t even have to invest in building a mobile app for your business.



The opt-in and click rates are amazing! Some of our early adopters have seen an opt-in rate of 40% (10X the rate at which an average email list builds, and 20X the rate at which an average Twitter list populates) and a click rate of 20%. Of course, you get to see all this data, right in your PushCrew dashboard, updated real-time.



PushCrew enables Chrome push notifications, Firefox push notifications, and mobile push notifications on your website. We built PushCrew especially for your website because we know every communication that you send out could potentially convert into revenue. And we don’t want you to spend time, effort or energy in building beautiful newsletters that are being archived, left un-opened, or simply ignored!."

As finance enthusiasts ourselves, we’ve spent years both on and offline keeping up with the world of money. It’s hard to disagree with the fact that the internet has become the choice destination for most when it comes to the pursuit of information – there’s just so much of it available online! But let’s face it, having to decipher through brontobytes (that’s SIX levels above gigabytes, in case you’re wondering) of data and a gazillion (that’s a couple of levels above billions, we’d imagine) web pages is no fun. And that’s precisely why, like free home delivery, we send you bite-sized nuggets of useful finance-related information that is engineered to solve everyday issues we all encounter with our dollars and cents."

My career evolved from software developer at Infosys, Amdocs to building and managing an end-to-end e-commerce solution at NurseryLive. I am a self-motivated person and believe in continual learning.

An avid Nature lover by heart, it was this love for cultivating greener spaces around us that compelled me to take it to the next level. After much research, I realized the dearth of a single online solution to cater to all the aspects of gardening in India. It is when I along with Nidhi Singh decided to explore this lesser known segment.

Thus was born NurseryLive, the gardening platform that is on its way to change the dynamics of gardening in India.

Gardens have been an indispensable part of our homes, more so now, ever than before – thanks to the need of the hour to create greener spaces around us and our wish to live close to nature. Well, Gardening is not just about having a few plants in our backyard. It's an art of cultivating plants, a passionate hobby for many, to curate different plants that add to the beauty of our homes.

For Nidhi Singh, it was this love for cultivating greener spaces that compelled her to take it to the next level, beyond her home. The nursery market, with its highly fragmented setup, where a majority of the operations happen mainly in the offline sector and the oblivion of the people to create green spaces for the lack of space or the upscale costs of lands, set her thinking.

After much research, she realized the dearth of a single online space to cater to all the aspects of gardening in India. It is when Nidhi and her husband Nandu Singh decided to explore this lesser known segment. Thus was born NurseryLive, their thoughtful online venture that has been on its way to change the dynamics of gardening in India.

NurseryLive, an online nursery that started its active operations in October 2014, is India's largest online nursery, that has grown immensely in a short span of time, incurring high volume of sales and building a huge customer base. Headquartered in Pune, this online market for gardening products sells more than 5000 stock keeping units (SKUs) of plants, seeds and garden accessories, all available at a single place.

Whether you're a novice dreaming of making your living space greener or a gardening expert with several years of experience under your belly, NurseryLive is a platform that can address all your needs. This online platform has been receiving overwhelming support from garden lovers across India since its inception, with its consumer base spread all over India including individuals, corporate and small and medium nurseries.

With the outstanding effort of the founders who are currently overseeing the marketing campaigns by themselves, NurseryLive has connected more than 350,000 active garden lovers and has processed about 60,000 orders as of December 2016. At present, they cater to all the gardening needs across the country, bringing your favorite plants at your doorstep. They are in the process of further expansion and intend to establish local distribution centers to enable efficiency and achieve quick delivery of their products.

NurseryLive's vision of creating greener spaces around us and making the Earth a healthier place to live has attracted high popularity if there huge online presence are anything to go by.

Check out the various platforms from NurseryLive to know more about them:

                        integrating into each part of the application: client (iOS, Android, JS) and server (Ruby, Python, Node, PHP, many others). This gives us code-level visibility on errors that happen in production. When an error is detected, our libraries collect a wealth of data about the error (e.g. which lines of code) and its context (e.g. which user was affected), and report it to our API. Then we analyze, de-dupe, send alerts, and prepare the data for further analysis by the developer.

Large customers love us our ability to de-dupe millions of errors into root causes that they can search, sort, and prioritize. Teams of all sizes love being able to respond quickly to new bugs that appear in production, and rest easy knowing that when something breaks, Rollbar tells them."

Membangun media massa dalam dunia maya, merupakan pilihan kami saat ini. Yakni, menggunakan media elektronik dalam jaringan komputer yang banyak dipakai untuk keperluan komunikasi satu arah maupun timbal-balik secara online (terhubung langsung).



Kita tentu yakin dan maklum, dunia maya ini merupakan integrasi dari berbagai peralatan teknologi komunikasi dan jaringan komputer. (sensor, tranduser, koneksi, transmisi, prosesor, signal, kontroler) yang dapat menghubungkan peralatan komunikasi (komputer, telepon genggam, instrumentasi elektronik, dan lain-lain) yang tersebar di seluruh penjuru dunia secara interaktif.



Dengan konsep ini, kami hadir sebagai bagian dari trend yang akan terus berkembang di masa depan. Covesia.com, sebagaimana semangat yang kami bangun dalam tagline: '""Warna-Warni Indonesia', berusaha memotret warna-warni Indonesia dalam seluruh aspek. Covesia sendiri, merupakan semangat kami dalam memberikan ruang dan potret bagaimana sebuah cover (wajah) dari Indonesia masa kini, detik perdetik dalam perubahan yang alami.



Kami juga tak mau terjebak dalam patron sempit apalagi politis dan ideologi yang sempit pula. Kami akan berusaha tampil sebagaimana sifat informasi yang natural dan bersifat umum. Bagaikan makna musik yang bisa mempersatukan semua golongan dalam kerangka pruralisme dan universal.



Kami juga ingin membangun dunia maya, sebagaimana asal mula Kata ""cyberspace"" (dari cybernetics dan space) berasal dan pertama kali diperkenalkan oleh penulis novel fiksi ilmiah, William Gibson dalam buku ceritanya, ""Burning Chrome"", 1982 dan menjadi populer pada novel berikutnya, Neuromancer, 1984 yang menyebutkan bahwa:



""Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts. A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding"".

"Why does India need IndianMoney.com?

India needs IndianMoney.com

• Because it's unrealistic to expect genuine and unbiased free consultation from an agent or seller of financial products

• Because there is a need to get access ...
                        
See More
                        to experts who would highlight the fine print that needs to be read before signing on the dotted lines

• Because speaking to an expert can save hours/days spent on web search



Story behind IndianMoney.com

In early 2008 Mr.Sudheer C.S (founder, MD and CEO of IndianMoney.com) happened to meet an auto driver while working in a top MNC Broking house. The auto driver told him that one of the sales persons from his organization has sold him an insurance policy promising that ""If you pay Rs 25,000 once, you will get back Rs 1 lakh after 3 years"".

Mr. Sudheer knew there was no such policy available. When he read the policy document he realized that it was a Regular Premium ULIP policy, where customer has to pay Rs 25,000 each for 3 years. Based on the market performance, customer ""might"" get back Rs 50,000 or Rs 75,000 or Rs 1 lakh after 3 years.

It was clear that the humble auto driver wasn't made aware of the terms and conditions and complete details of the policy. It was literally impossible for an auto driver in Bangalore to save Rs. 25,000 a year for the rest of the installments. This incident shook Mr. Sudheer, he knew that there was a need for genuine, honest and unbiased financial advice and he instantly started thinking for a solution to end this problem. That's when IndianMoney.com was conceptualized, to end the unethical sales practices which are mostly in practice in the Financial Services Industry.

Mr. Sudheer paid Rs. 25,000 to the auto driver so that he at least recovers the money he had put into and also submitted his resignation to his CEO.

When Homestay.com started, we made a promise: to bring you real travel experiences. To offer something genuine, a real taste of life around the world.



Something extraordinary and unforgettable that takes you to the heart of the culture and community you’re visiting, that shows you what it’s really like to live in that place, what it looks like from the warmth of a real family rather than the isolation of yet another hotel room or empty apartment.



So, together with our trusted global network, we established a community of homestay hosts, each of whom welcome visitors to stay in their home. Each host gives you a really affordable alternative to ordinary tourist accommodation. You’ll share a meal, learn customs, hear stories and enjoy traditions with the people that really make the place what it is.



It offers so much more than ordinary travel, where you observe a place and its people from a distance. It’s an unmissable opportunity to see beyond the usual tourist trail. To not just see the country, but to experience it as it’s meant to be experienced."

Tradesparq's social sourcing platform works by allowing importers to upload their trade contacts, and then uses its proprietary search engine to match results from product searches to their contacts, down to second level connections. This lets buyers easily find and get references from others in their network who have previously worked with a supplier."

See More
                         of more advanced options. 



Here is a short overview:



* Automations can be very complex. You can automate an **unlimited number of consecutive actions**, not just 1:1 (if this:then that). Each action has at its disposal data returned by previous actions. This allows you to automate your entire workflow, not just one part.



* Integromat gives you the possibility to use built-in **routers to duplicate any incoming data**. Using routers, you can divide your scenario into multiple routes and process data separately in each route. 



* Integromat supports **dynamically created inputs and outputs**. Thanks to this feature you can, for example, call remote database procedures and map their input and output variables. It’s a function that you won´t find anywhere else.



* Built-in **feeders** are special modules that can split incoming data into multiple parts and then process each part separately. For example, if you receive an email with multiple attachments, you can handle each attachment separately.



* **Aggregators**, on the other hand, allow to merge individual data into a single bundle. We can, for example, create a ZIP archive of files contained in a specific folder and then save it or send it anywhere.



* We can work with files as if they were **binary data**. Therefore we do not need to know the path to a folder. This lets you, for example, transform images or work with file content as with a text.



* Another unique feature is the possibility to **schedule webhooks**. With Integromat you can, for example, make an automation that will gather text messages received on your mobile phone during a day and then at midnight select a winner. Standard webhooks are of course also supported.



* We support **serialization and deserialization of JSON** documents and give you the possibility to work with your data in any way. Nested objects or fields are no problem for us.



* Thanks to the **transaction processing of data**, Integromat is able to complete an entire automation as scheduled. In case of error, Integromat reverts all changes and restores the initial state. In short, it will either perform all actions as scheduled or nothing.



* Integromat stores **incomplete runs (DLQ)**. If an automation encounters an error, we will save its state. This ensures that no data are lost. You can then fix the issue and continue executing from where it was stopped.



* Perfect **visualization of everything you do**. From possibility to watch how your automation is being executed to visualization of data flow in the Execution history."

                        most tools have major shortcomings - such as being restricted to just one format (such as GIF, PNG or JPEG). Many tools will simply force an image down to a particular quality level such as a quality setting of 70 for JPEG images, regardless of what the results look like. And even after processing images through such tools, we find that there are still significant byte savings to be made on most images, without significantly impacting their visual detail.



That's where Kraken.io fits in to the equation.



Kraken's optimization algorithms excel at determining the optimal balance of image quality and filesize, often greatly reducing image size while retaining sufficient quality for the vast majority of use cases. This means, for the publisher, more efficient use of storage and network bandwidth, and for the end user faster loading pages and apps, and a generally better user experience."

The intuitive graphical interface makes it easy to select the securities that make up one or more pie, with the ability to change the portfolio at any time. 



Automatic rebalancing: M1 Finance dynamically rebalances the portfolio as funds move in and out – using contributions to buy underweight positions and withdrawals to sell overweight positions. In addition, investors can rebalance portfolios at any time with a click of the button. 



Fully invested: M1 Finance enables clients to be fully invested in their pre-defined portfolio at all times. As such, it offers next-day availability of most funds and the ability to purchase fractional shares – ensuring that every penny is put to work. 



Commission-free investing: M1 Finance is an investing platform, not a trading platform. As such, it does not charge commissions to buy and sell individual securities. Instead, the company charges a minimal 0.35 percent annual platform usage fee, regardless of the number"

Back in 2013, we recognised a recurring problem in the job market. Access to a trustworthy database of candidates in the entry level and blue collar job segments was largely restricted, and the hiring process highly disorganised. This was due to a crippling unavailability of information regarding skill benchmarks as well as job requirements. It was therefore essential to create a repository of data containing information about jobs as well as candidates in this segment. Aasaanjobs was thus born as a means to address this problem.



As part of the India story, we seek to leverage India’s rich human resource by making hiring easy for all parties involved - job seekers as well as employers. To achieve this, we have initiated the process of creating a digital identity for every job seeker. We have also launched an exhaustive outreach programme to attract skilled candidates. We therefore aspire to create a system where requirement based hiring results in a perfect match with a candidate’s abilities."

Since our start in 2008, we've come to manage 250,000+ domains, and we like to think the experience we offer is second to none. So next time you start a little web project, keep us in mind. We'd love to be your new favorite domain registrar."

                        timized PHP and Database setups are essentially platform defaults now instead of the customer trying to figure it out on their own with a mix of plugins and research. More sensible resource balancing on shared setups (old shared hosting providers were notorious for overselling). Collectively these things have made WordPress dramatically faster (vs. a default install) in most use cases.



Security: Some level of malware/file scanning, hardened OS installs, least-privileged access, web application firewalls and DDoS mitigation may be defaults at most Managed WordPress providers now. You don’t hear about widespread security issues as we did in say the 2008-2011 period. Those that come up are mitigated quickly by the Core team (or the respective plugin author) and aided by rapidly deployed patches or firewall rules by the Managed hosts.



Tooling: Automating installs, code updates, and backups along with staging and deployment workflows enabled development teams to work faster and create more complex yet stable sites on WordPress.



Support: More knowledgeable support technicians that understand WordPress to a higher degree than a generic web host. Some providers are better than others but all seem to at least make an attempt to specialize in the unique support requirements of WordPress. Here at Pagely we take great pride in our quality over quantity approach to support ensuring that every agent is not only deeply skilled in WordPress but proficient in the core technical skills of DevOps and deployment management allowing them to address any performance or security issue that may arise.



What’s next for Pagely?

It’s odd to look at the landscape, this $1 Billion-channel we created (and of course others helped to grow) and reflect on where we fit in the picture going forward. For us, it’s fairly simple – do more of the things that have made us successful thus far: Investing in our people and focusing on the customer. It’s a recipe that wins over the long term."

We opened an office, hired top sales talent, and signed up clients within the first few weeks. It was clear that there was a huge demand for this service.



Next, we searched the market for the best technologies available. Unfortunately, we came back disappointed.



Nothing was designed to help salespeople sell more successfully. Existing solutions seemed to be focused on turning sales professionals into data entry specialists.



None of them showed any understanding of the needs of a sales person when it came to their job and daily workflow.



After a lot of frustration we decided to fix the problem instead of complaining about it.

We started developing our own internal sales application, which we lovingly called our secret sales sauce.



It took 1.5 years of development and iteration with our internal development and sales team to realize our vision and create something truly special.



During that time our sales people generated millions of dollars in sales for hundreds of venture backed Silicon Valley startups using our secret sales sauce: Close.io.



We knew we were sitting on something special when we got more and more demand from other people who wanted to use our internal software.



At first we resisted (there is a reason we called it our secret sauce after all), but eventually we realized that making the sales software available to other teams was the right thing to do.



In January 2013 we finally released Close.io to the world."

                        rds cost merchants 2.9% + 30c per transaction. For most retailers, processing fees are second only to rental and real estate expenses.



Sezzle has created a new online payment platform that leverages the low-cost ACH payment system, enabling us to charge merchants 1.5% + 15c per transaction, or half the going rate. ACH has historically been used only for large, recurring payments like payroll and mortgages because it was inefficient and cumbersome for consumers. Sezzle’s platform makes paying via ACH fast and easy.



First-time users are asked to login to their bank and create a PIN during sign-up, and once complete, we require only a consumer’s mobile number and PIN to complete a purchase. Consumers are rewarded with 1% cash back on every Sezzle purchase, to incentivize them to switch from other payment methods. And the user experience is much better than PayPal or plastic."

The idea of launching ""Go! Go! Nihon"", the first website of the company, came from Davide, who, felt the need to create a service that would make the process of coming to Japan for studying and living a much easier task than before. 



After Go! Go! Nihon - Live and Study in Japan, the company launched Go! Go! Hanguk - Live and Study in Korea, strengthening the position of the company as world leader for studying abroad services in East Asia. 



With our help, you can find a school that matches your requirements, to make you become a great speaker of the language of your choice and live in the area of your dreams. We will also give you all the information you need to find a part-time job and get used to the lifestyle abroad, helping you have the experience of a lifetime. 



Go! Go! Nihon offers several services to the language schools that live up to our teaching quality standards, to help them to attract more students because we strongly believe that is worth to study in those schools. Unlike other services out there, we don't charge extra for our work, because we believe that everyone that wishes to study and live abroad should have this chance. We also make sure you pay the same, up-to-date or even lower tuition fee compared to if you applied directly to the school and doing all the research and preparations on your own. Last but not least, we will keep in contact with you after your arrival, making sure that you get precise advice from our staff on how you can save even more money during your stay in Japan."

                        chnology has become cheaper and more easily accessible. Most job seekers are unaware that ATS technology is used by most companies and is designed to scan the resume looking for keywords, experience, education, and other factors to determine if the candidate is right for the position. Over 75% of resumes submitted are rejected by ATS software before it's ever seen by a human. 



Zipjob helps job seekers create and optimize resumes to help beat both the ATS and impress hiring managers. Zipjob matches customers to a certified resume writer who also use the same ATS technology to screen the resume. This tells the writer what needs to be optimized and whether the resume is being rejected by the technology. The most common reason over 75% of resumes are rejected are the incorrect use of keywords, incorrect formatting, and grammatical errors. 



Customers can also easily upload and download their resume as well as message their writer through an easy to use dashboard. Through the use of technology and certified resume writers, Zipjob equips job seekers with a resume that not only gets past the bots but also impresses the hiring manager."

In these challenging economic times, restaurants have found they can actually attract new markets of customers and increase their revenue by utilizing online services like Delivery Hero that target specific, tech-savvy consumers. It's all about knowing what matters most to customers right now and being able to deliver it. Focusing on home delivery became the go-to solution for restaurants during the recession of 2001 when their tables remained empty. But since 2008, restaurants have found that strategy is simply not enough. Now restaurant owners must respond to the global financial crisis by offering their customers a new and better solution: online food ordering services like Delivery Hero that are tailored to the consumer."

                         create your own personal chatbot, which you can then implement on your own website for certain purposes. But why should you do that and how is Rebot.me going to help you achieve anything other than entertainment? Read on to find out more.

How does Rebot.me work?

Typically, people have a wrong notion that creating and managing a chatbot is a difficult and involves complex programming. However, we at Rebot.me ensure developing a chatbot is very simple which can be done by anyone, with or without knowledge about programming. First off, you will need to create a free account. After that, you can start creating your personal chatbot. Customize it through the use of various tools and then start ‘teaching’ it to respond to certain questions. As you spend more time talking to it, it’ll ‘learn’ more and more answers to certain questions you want it to answer. Now, it may seem fun and it is – but it can really be used as a nice and entertaining marketing tool. Say you have a visitor on your website and you want them to get familiarized quicker with whatever you offer, be it service or product. Simply ‘teach’ your chatbot to respond to questions users will likely pose. It’ll save you the time needed to do so yourself and you’ll also keep visitors hooked on your online resource longer, which can mean better conversion rates in the long run.

It is very simple

You may think chatbots involves genius minds in order to be created or you must need to pay a good sum of dollars only to acquire a chatbot in your website or to add it on software application. But this should not be the case anymore. Stop thinking about the difficulty of creating a chatbot, because believe it or not, you, yourself can now develop it. Do you want to know how to create a personal chatbot? Do you wonder where can you easily get help in developing your own chatbot? Well, lucky you because Rebot.me is offering you with a simple yet effective way to create your own chatbot. Through their service, you are sure to create in a hassle-free process, a chatbot ideal for own personal purpose and benefits.

Benefits of service

Many companies include chatbots in their website and software applications since there is a high potential of marketability and profitability in the utilization of chatbots. Through chatbots, companies can promote their product or services. They can easily know what their customers are thinking and what they exactly want for a product. Customers can ask some significant questions and at the same time, given direct answer through a chatbot. Overall, chatbots is an easy way of information access between two individuals."

                        te por advogados e profissionais de tecnologia. Todos com mais de 10 anos de experiência em suas áreas



HISTÓRIA E TECNOLOGIA

O Modelo Inicial nasceu no início de 2016 com o objetivo de criar uma plataforma de conteúdo jurídico focada em proporcionar melhores resultados processuais para os profissionais de direito. Nossa visão é que apenas através da utilização agressiva da tecnologia isso seria possível, tanto para nossa equipe interna quanto para os usuários finais.

Com base nisso, montamos uma equipe multidisciplinar sólida e qualificada de advogados e analistas de sistemas, todos com no mínimo 10 anos de experiência em suas áreas, com a missão latente de revolucionar a forma com que modelos e petições são desenvolvidos no Brasil.

O resultado foi o desenvolvimento de softwares de construção estruturada de petições, análise de jurisprudência, jurimetria, ultra-personalização de conteúdo, robotização e inteligência artificial moldados especificamente para o contexto de criação de documentos jurídicos. E para o usuário final, uma interface rica e simples de utilizar, capaz de orientar o advogado passo a passo no preenchimento de cada campo dos modelos, identificar anexos necessários, oferecer dicas gerais, facilitar a busca e descoberta de peças, organizar, armazenar, compartilhar e até gerar o PDF final pronto para ser impresso ou distribuído diretamente em qualquer processo eletrônico.

MODELO EDITORIALNós não acreditamos em modelos de petições originados de processos artesanais e empíricos. Quando necessário, a petição final é que deve conter os traços específicos do advogado autor, o qual conhece o tribunal de destino da petição e o cliente pessoalmente, juntamente com todas as particularidades do caso. Uma petição que por ventura tenha sucesso em função da retórica do autor, apesar de ter sido bem sucedida uma vez, certamente terá estatisticamente uma chance menor de ter sucesso novamente quando confrontada com outro juiz ou tribunal, ou com um caso sensivelmente diferente.

Nós como produtores de conteúdo jurídico portanto acreditamos em modelos calcados na análise fria da jurisprudência, dos fatos, do direito, das leis, das provas apresentadas e dos fatores que levam um grupo de ações semelhantes a obter sucesso ao final. O resultado são modelos sólidos e objetivos, com instruções práticas para maximizar a chance de sucesso da ação, tudo baseado em jurisprudência atual e jurimetria favorável.

METODOLOGIA

Nossos modelos não são baseados portanto no sucesso de uma única ação ou na experiência de um único advogado, mas sim na análise dos fatores relevantes ao sucesso de um grupo de ações bem sucedidas. Nós chamamos isso de “engenharia reversa de jurisprudência”. Ou seja, partimos do resultado final (ações bem sucedidas) e desconstruímos o processo em modelos que maximizam e orientam o advogado a seguir a mesma linha de pensamento e entendimento dos tribunais quanto às leis vigentes e sua aplicabilidade.

Nossa proposta de qualidade do serviço não se limita apenas à qualificação e experiência pessoal da nossa equipe jurídica, mas também à tecnologia que empregamos e que possibilita nossa equipe ir além em suas análises para a criação e atualização de conteúdo.

ALÉM DO DIREITO“Um modelo de petição é um software, e não um simples documento. Deve portanto ser estruturada como uma aplicação completa, e não como um documento do word!”

Com essa máxima, nossa equipe jurídica é quase tão desenvolvedora de softwares quanto nossa equipe de TI. As aplicações criadas pela equipe de TI permitiram que cada advogado fosse capaz de criar sozinho modelos estruturados e conscientes de suas relações com outros modelos, das entradas e saídas de dados, propriedades, fases, blocos opcionais, etc., resultado em uma experiência mais rica para o usuário final e uma produtividade até então impensável.

VISÃO E NOVOS PRODUTOSOs advogados não estão sozinhos. A tecnologia, parte indivisível do DNA do Modelo Inicial, veio para entregar ganhos de produtividade e eficiência reais, e por isso reunimos em nossa essência a missão de produzir de forma orgânica e integrada conteúdos jurídicos e tecnologias de altíssimo padrão.

Nossa visão de lançamento de novos produtos portanto é utilizar-se dessa experiência e capital humano ímpar para aparelhar advogados de todo o Brasil com tecnologias e conteúdos que tornem o seu trabalho mais eficiente."

                        Great Recession has diminished their trust in conventional banking. Qapital uses gamified, automatic savings to allow its customers set aside small amounts of money regularly, so they can have the things they want — without relying on credit.



Customers can create a unique and fun (yes, fun) savings plan that blends seamlessly into their lifestyle. The product enables them to set up ""rules"" that trigger automatic savings for a specific goal. As an example, every time a Qapital user resists the temptation to buy a latte, she can trigger the app to put the equivalent cost into an FDIC-backed Qapital account. Users can direct these savings toward a goal of their choosing, such as a trip to Paris or a security deposit on a new apartment, or set them aside as a rainy-day fund."
