Read actively 
The world has reached a saturation point of shallow, thoughtless content, and half-skimming through these pages of filler is increasingly unfulfilling. Every day, your Medium homepage is full of stories with depth and meaning — Stories that make you laugh, cry, and actually feel things. Reading these stories is not a passive activity. At Medium, we are building a better way to read. Every highlight you leave changes the way others interpret the story — and maybe even the way author thinks about what they wrote. Influence the discussion Discourse is necessary. Ideas grow by bumping into other brains and breathing in fresh air. That’s why we created Medium Responses. Beyond a simple comment, Responses are your opportunity to influence the discussion. And since Responses are their own posts, they build on each other and evolve the original idea in new and unexpected directions. When you sign up for Medium, you are joining a community of millions of thinkers and doers offering their best ideas and moving conversation forward on the biggest issues and interests of the day. Because great writing deserves a great audience."
